This was an assignment for a class I took in Spring Semester 2024 (January-May) to showcase my ability to 
implement the common sorting methods:
 * Bubble Sort
 * Selection Sort
 * Insertion Sort
 * Shell Sort
 * Merge Sort (public method and a private one that is called by the public)
 * Quick Sort (via three functions)
